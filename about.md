Hi! My Name is Mubaris NK. I'm an Information Technology student at [IIITA](https://iiita.ac.in). As a student I am interested in all topics ranging from Astrophysics to Psychology. When I started learning Data Science, I thought I should write about it. That's the reason I started **The Morning Data**. Mainly I will write about things related to Data Science in the **The Morning Data**.
